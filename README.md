## How to Run Uppaal 
Uppaal will require Java SDK 32 Bit to Run

Once you open Uppaal.exe
Then Open our file to Run
All the Variables and Paths will be set
You can then simulate all of the Paths using the Simulate Option

## Folder Contents
The folder contains all the pictures, files,zip files of source code
And etc.
Team 19: this is the power point file that we prepared for presentation
And it has all the details how we made the file and the methodology that we have used.
The xml file has 3 templates inside each template has a work to do
First template says the states of nuclear power plant 
The second template has the signals that first template sent to the program
And the third template simplifies everything and put forward to give any answer as a state of nuclear power plant. I.e, normal, engeneering or trip.
Final Report - This contains the report that we have written using IEEE format in overleaf.  This has all the information such as the class diagrams, sequence diagrams, etc. We have also described and explained the code that we have written using Uppaal. We have also shown the result and analysis of the project, where we discuss the safety analysis of the Nuclear Power Plant


##Tools Used
1. Overleaf, for Latex report generation
2. Uppaal, for Path Simulation
